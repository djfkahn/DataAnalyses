# Building a NHL Playoff Contender

This analysis is performed in the file 'NHLRegSeasonWinners.ipynb'.  It must be opened in Jupyter Lab to be viewed and executed.

Some of the steps in this analysis are computationally intensive...especially retrieving the data from the NHL API and formulating the pair-plots.  When executing, be prepared to allow ample time for these steps (several minutes each).
